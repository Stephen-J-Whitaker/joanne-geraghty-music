# **Joanne Geraghty Music**

The ‘Joanne Geraghty Music’ site provides a hub for Jo’s music business. It caters for fans, potential fans, prospective and current clients and curious visitors by providing the information and features required for the type of user in question to fulfil their objective or objectives. This is done through provision of details commonly sought by these user groups and provision of the intuitively arranged features they require.
 It was a goal of the design process to develop a site that would provide for a type of user’s needs without being to the detriment of another type of user. This being the case would lead to a less positive user experience. 
The overall objective is for the site to be an enjoyable destination for any user, for it to enable the user to make the most of Jos music and Jo, in turn, to gain and retain followers, increase bookings and sales and build a thriving fan base that attends her performances regularly.
